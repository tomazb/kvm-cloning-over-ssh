# KVM Cloning over SSH - Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the KVM Cloning over SSH project. This tool enables secure cloning and synchronization of KVM virtual machines between hosts using libvirt API over SSH connections.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tomazb/kvm-cloning-over-ssh.git
cd kvm-cloning-over-ssh

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Clone a VM
kvm-clone clone source-host dest-host vm-name

# Synchronize a VM
kvm-clone sync source-host dest-host vm-name

# List VMs
kvm-clone list host1 host2
```

## 📚 Documentation Sections

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/kvm_clone/
├── client.py          # Main KVMCloneClient class
├── cloner.py          # VM cloning operations
├── sync.py            # VM synchronization operations
├── transport.py       # SSH transport layer
├── libvirt_wrapper.py # Libvirt API wrapper
├── models.py          # Data models and structures
├── exceptions.py      # Custom exceptions
└── cli.py             # Command-line interface
```

## ✨ Key Features

### ✅ Implemented
- **Complete VM Cloning** - Full VM cloning with disk images and configuration
- **Incremental Synchronization** - Delta-based sync for efficient updates
- **SSH Transport** - Secure transfers using SSH with key-based authentication
- **Libvirt Integration** - Native libvirt API support for VM management
- **CLI Interface** - Comprehensive command-line interface
- **Async Operations** - Non-blocking operations with progress tracking
- **Type Safety** - Full type annotations for better development experience

### 🚧 In Development
- **Enhanced Test Coverage** - Expanding test suite to reach 90% coverage
- **Performance Optimization** - Parallel transfers and bandwidth limiting
- **Advanced Features** - Resume capability, compression, integrity verification

## 🔧 Development

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Poetry for dependency management
- libvirt development libraries
- SSH access to target hosts

### Setting up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and switch to develop branch
git clone https://github.com/tomazb/kvm-cloning-over-ssh.git
cd kvm-cloning-over-ssh
git checkout develop

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Build documentation
make docs
```

## 🐍 Python API Example

```python
import asyncio
from kvm_clone import KVMCloneClient

async def clone_vm():
    async with KVMCloneClient() as client:
        result = await client.clone_vm(
            source_host="source.example.com",
            dest_host="dest.example.com",
            vm_name="my-vm",
            new_name="my-vm-clone",
            compress=True,
            verify=True
        )
        
        if result.success:
            print(f"Successfully cloned VM: {result.new_vm_name}")
        else:
            print(f"Clone failed: {result.error}")

asyncio.run(clone_vm())
```
